    <h1>Open World 3D view of Undersea Realty:Conch Street -Computer_Graphics</h1>
    
<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Step into the whimsical underwater realm of Conch Street, where our interactive 3D
experience reimagines the beloved neighborhood from the iconic animated series. Designed
to immerse players in the charming world of SpongeBob SquarePants, this project invites
users to explore a vibrant digital recreation of Bikini Bottom’s most famous street. As users
navigate through the environment using keyboard controls, they’ll encounter familiar homes,
quirky characters, and a unique twist— each resident is looking to sell their underwater
abode.
